## Description
Team Profile Generator is a command-line program that creates a webpage containing profile info of a company's team members. The user is prompted for details on team members (Manager, Engineers, and Interns). Upon completion, a cleanly-formatted webpage with functioning links is generated, and the user is automatically directed to the page in their browser.

## Installation
1. Navigate to this project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/noah35becker/team-profile-generator)
2. Click the green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP"
3. Unzip the downloaded folder
4. Rename the unzipped folder if you want, and move it wherever you'd like on your drive
5. Open the terminal, ```cd``` to the program folder you just downloaded, and then run the command ```npm install``` (*you must have Node.js [installed](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) for this to work)
6. Once ```npm install``` finishes running, you're all set!


## Usage
If you haven't already, open the terminal and ```cd``` to the program folder you downloaded during [installation](#installation). Then run the command ```node index.js``` to begin. The program should be self-explanatory.

After running the program, a generated HTML file titled ```my-team.html``` will appear in the program folder's "dist" subfolder. <b>Beware that running the program to completion again in the future will <i>overwrite</i> this file.</b>
